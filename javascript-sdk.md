# Marketcloud Javascript SDK 



This is the documentation for the official Marketcloud Javascript SDK. It is a wrapper for our REST api and it makes it easier to use. This document provides an API reference for versions 2.0.0 and above of the SDK, we highly recommend to use the latest version of the SDK and before upgrading, please read the [changelog](https://github.com/Marketcloud/marketcloud-js/wiki/Note-for-Version-2.0.0).

## Introduction

If you haven't set up an application yet, please refer to the [Getting Started](/documentation/rest-api/gettingstarted) section. You can also check out our API Reference for more detailed information about our SDK.

In Marketcloud, you create an App for each of your web/mobile applications. Each App has its own public key that you insert into your web app. Your account on Marketcloud can handle multiple Apps.



## Installation

You can get the javascript SDK from [Github](https://github.com/Marketcloud/marketcloud-js):

```
git clone https://github.com/Marketcloud/marketcloud-js.git
```

Or you can use bower:

```
bower install marketcloud-js
```

At this point you can include the minified javascript file in your application

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/marketcloud.min.js"></script>
```



## Authentication and security

Every application identifies itself to Marketcloud using a unique public key. Since you must ship the public key with your client application code, this key is **public**. The application security is guaranteed by the secret key, which you should never share with anyone. The only place where it should be safe to store and use the secret key is (in case you need it) your server side code.

```javascript
//Create a new instance of the client
  var marketcloud = new Marketcloud.Client({
    public_key : 'your-apps-public-key'
  })

```

> **Note**
> By default, the SDK will have very limited write and read access. Most write operations will require user authentication. If the default user authorizations are not enough for your application (for example if you are building a Marketplace) you can create new user roles. [Learn more](#)

Some methods requires a user authorization token. This is because, for example, only logged users should be able to edit their profile informations, or review their orders and items in carts. Whenever a method requires authentication, you will see a  label.

In order to authenticate a user, use the [users.authenticate()](#users) method.



## Promises

Even if the examples in this reference use callbacks, starting with version 2.0.0 of the SDK, each endpoint method also returns a promise.

```javascript
//This will work
marketcloud.products.list({},function(err,response){
 console.log("My products:",response.data);
})

//And also this works
marketcloud.products.list({})
.then(function(response){
  console.log("My products:",response.data);
})
.catch(function(error){
  console.log("Something went wrong",error);
})

```

For using promises, the SDK needs Bluebird as a dependency. If you are installing this SDK with NPM or Bower, they will handle dependencies for you.



## Sorting

Whenever you are requesting a list of resources, using a `list(query,callback)` method, you can pass sorting parameters to the query object:

```javascript

client.products.list({
  sort_by : "name",
  sort_order : "ASC"
})

```javascript

`sort_by` is the name of the attribute you want to use for sorting and `sort_order` can have two values, `ASC` or `DESC`.

  }
  marketcloud.orders.create(the_order,function(err,response){
  });     

```

## Payment methods

Payment methods are a way to describe how customers will pay the goods they are buying. We have some default payment methods which are integrated into the system such as Braintree and Stripe, but your store might want some custom methods, such as cash on delivery.

#### Usage with orders

In order to tell Marketcloud that an order is using a certain payment method, just create an order with a `payment_method_id` value. See [orders.create](#orders.create) for an example



### Retrieve a payment method

```javascript
//Retrieves a payment method by its id
  marketcloud.paymentMethods.getById(payment_method_id, function(err,response){

});
```



### List all payment methods

```javascript
//Retrieves a list of payment methods filtered and sorted by the query object
  marketcloud.paymentMethods.list(query, function(err,response){
});
```



## Payments

Marketcloud supports a certain number of payment methods. Most of them requires client side and server side configuration, we try to abstract the server side part, so you just have to configure client side scripts.

You can find the list of payment methods supported by Marketcloud in your application's dashboard under the **settings** > **payments** page. There you will also find a link to the documentation related to each payment method.

> **Info**
> In order to create payments using a payment method, you must enable and configure that method in your dashboard.



### Create a payment

#### Arguments



| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| method  **Required**  | String | A valid name of one of the supported payment methods. You can see a list of supported payment methods in Dashboard > settings > payments. |
| order_id | Integer | The id of the order related to this payment. |
|  | Mixed | Every payment method requires different additional parameters. Refer to the payment method documentation for more informations. |



#### Example request

```javascript

// Braintree example
var payment = {
  method: 'Braintree',
  order_id: created_order.id,
  nonce: 'nonce-from-braintree.js'
};

marketcloud.payments.create(payment);

// Stripe example
var payment = {
  method: 'Stripe',
  order_id: created_order.id,
  source: 'value-from-stripe.js'
};

marketcloud.payments.create(payment);

// In both cases, nonce and source are obtained from Braintree
// and Stripe servers using their client side SDKs

```



## Products



### Retrieve a product

```javascript
//Retrieves a product by its id
  marketcloud.products.getById(product_id, function(err,response){

});
```

**product** is in the following form:

```javascript

  {
      "id": 1111,
      "name": "The lord of the rings",
      "sku": "TLOTR",
      "price": 15.50,
      "description": "A brief description of this fantastic book.",
      "published": true,
      "stock_level": 30,
      "stock_type": "track",
      "stock_status": null
  }

```

Products can also have custom attributes! :

```javascript

  {
      "id": 13687,
      "name": "A song of fire and ice: A feast for crows",
      "sku": "ASOFAI_AFFC",
      "price": 7.79,
      "description": "A brief description of this fantastic book.",
      "published": true,

      "genre": "Fantasy",
      "cover": "Paperback",
      "publication_year": "2001"
    }

```

Note that starting from author, the remaining fields are custom attributes defined when the product was created.



### List all products

Retrieves a list of products filtered and sorted by the query object.

#### Arguments



| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| q | String | Filter results performing a text research on your products. |
| price_gt | Number | Display only products that cost more than the specified value. |
| price_lt | Number | Display only products that cost less than the specified value. |
| category | String | Display only products that belongs to the specified category path or to a sub category. For example, `?category=/shoes` matches all producs in categories /shoes, /shoes/running /shoes/classic and other subcategories of "shoes" |
| `` | Mixed | Filter products by any custom field. |
| fields | String | Comma separated list of attribute names to retrieve. Use it to retrieve only the fields you need. |
| per_page | Number | The number of products to retrieve per page |
| page | Number | The page number of products to display |



#### Example request

```javascript
//Retrieves a list of products filtered and sorted by the query object
  marketcloud.products.list(query, function(err,response){
})
```

The query parameter is an object and you can use it to filter your products.

```javascript
var query = {
    category_id : 5,
    price_lt:50
  }

```

The previous example queries the api for products that belongs to the category with id equal to 5 and that cost less than 50

## Promotions



### Retrieve a promotion

```javascript
//Retrieves a promotion by its id
  marketcloud.categories.getById(category_id, function(err,response){

});
```



### List all promotions

```javascript
//Retrieves a list of promotions filtered and sorted by the query object
  marketcloud.promotions.list(query, function(err,response){
});
```



### Get by cart id

```javascript
//Retrieves a list of promotions eligible for a specific cart
  marketcloud.promotions.getByCart(cart_id, function(err,response){
});
```

## Users

### Checking if a user is authenticated

Whenever you create a new instance of the client (at pageloads for example), it immediatly looks for a user token in the current environment (the browser). If the client find user information, it populates the value `client.token`.

If you want to check if the current user already has an auth token:

```javascript

var client = new Marketcloud.Client({publicKey : '...'});
if (client.token) {
  // Then the user is authenticated and its data is in
  console.log(client.currentUser);
} else {
  // User not authenticated, prompt the user for username and password
}

```



### Authenticate a user

### Authenticate with username and password

Authenticates a user with email and password. Under the hood, the marketcloud api tests the user credentials and if they are valid, a token is received from the API and stored in the user's browser.

```javascript

marketcloud.users.authenticate('john.snow@wall.com','IKnowNothing',
  function(err,response){
    //data.user contains user data
})      

```

If the authentication is successful, `data` is an object:

```javascript
{
  user : {
    email : "john.doe@example.com",
    full_name : "John Doe",
    custom_attribute : "Some Value"
  },
  token : "SECRET_TOKEN"
}

```

### Authenticate with Facebook

Authenticates a user using Facebook login. Please, note that using this authentication strategy requires a couple more setup steps on the Facebook side. We have a [dedicated guide](/documentation/guides/facebook-login) to help you get started with Facebook and Marketcloud.

```javascript

marketcloud.users.authenticateWithFacebook(user_id,access_token,
  function(err,response){
    //data.user contains user data
})      

```

The data object is the same as in the authenticate() method.



### Logout

This method will log the user out, forgetting the auth token and the current cart's id

```javascript

marketcloud.users.logout();     

```



### Check login status

This method will return true if there is a local auth token. False otherwise.

```javascript
var isLogged = marketcloud.users.isAuthenticated();

```



### Create a user

Use this method to register users to you eCommerce app.

```javascript

  //Authenticates a user given email and password
  marketcloud.users.create({
                    name: "John Snow",
                    email: "john.snow@thewall.com",
                    password : "IknowKnothing"
              },function(err,response){
  })      

```



### Retrieve the currently authenticated user



```javascript

//Returns complete informations about the currently authenticated user
marketcloud.users.getCurrent(function(err,response){

})      

```



### Update a user



```javascript

//Update the information about the currently authenticated user
marketcloud.users.update({email : 'newaddress@example.com'},function(err,response){

})      

```



### Delete a user



```javascript

  //Delete the currently authenticated user
  marketcloud.users.delete(function(err){
  })      

```

## Variables

```javascript
//Retrieves a variable by its id
  marketcloud.variables.getById(variable_id, function(err,response){

});
```



### List all variables
